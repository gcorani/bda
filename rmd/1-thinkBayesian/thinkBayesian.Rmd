# The big picture

* We continuously update our knowledge about the world as we accumulate  experience or collect data. 

\bigskip


* The Bayesian probability is a rigorous framework for modeling the knowledge-building process, using data to update your knowledge. 


# Changing opinion based on experience


* Suppose there’s a new restaurant with high online rating.

\bigskip

* Prior to enter the restaurant, you expect that it will be  delicious.

\bigskip

* On your first visit, the pasta is poorly cooked.

\bigskip

* You weigh the high online rating against  your poor meal (which might have just been a fluke), and you update your opinion knowledge: this is a medium, not an excellent restaurant.

# Changing opinion based on experience

*   In your second meal at the restaurant you’re pleased with your dinner and increase your personal restaurant’s rating to good.

\bigskip

* You continue to visit the restaurant, collecting edible data and updating your knowledge each time.

\bigskip

* After enough visits, you have your own informed opinion.

# Building knowledge

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("restaurant_diagram.png")
```

* We can apply this same Bayesian process to rigorous research inquiries.


# Building knowledge

* An environmental scientist analyses of the human role in climate change.

\bigskip

* He carries a degree of incoming or prior information based on previous research and experience.

\bigskip

* In light of this information he interprets new data, considering both to develop an updated understanding (posterior information).

\bigskip

* He continues to refine this information as he gathers new evidence.

# Thinking  Bayesian

* When flipping a fair coin, we say that “the probability of flipping Heads is 0.5.” How do you interpret this probability?

\bigskip

  * If I flip this coin over and over, roughly 50% will be Heads.

  \bigskip

  *  Heads and Tails are equally plausible.

# Thinking  Bayesian

 * According to both Bayesian and frequentist probability,  the probability of observing Heads on a fair coin flip is 1/2. The difference is in their interpretation:

\bigskip

  * Bayesian: a probability measures the relative plausibility of an event.
    The frequentist philosophy is so named for its interpretation of probability as the long-run relative frequency of a repeatable event

# Thinking  Bayesian

* An election is coming up and a pollster claims that candidate A has a 0.9 probability of winning. How do you interpret this probability?

  \bigskip

  * If we observe the election over and over, candidate A will win roughly 90% of the time.

  \bigskip

  * Candidate A is much more likely to win than to lose.
